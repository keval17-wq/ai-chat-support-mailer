The Project Roadmap: An Evolving Journey
The @keval17-wq/ai-chat-support-mailer SDK is designed to evolve from a focused, niche solution into a versatile, AI-powered communication engine. The project's development is planned in a phased approach, ensuring new capabilities are added systematically while maintaining the stability of the core system.

Phase 1: Support Mailer (Current)
This phase represents the current state of the SDK. The primary goal is to provide a robust, reliable tool for automating the email-based support workflow.

Functionality: Generates and sends emails for support requests.

Key Features:

AI Drafting: Leverages OpenAI to automatically create professional, context-aware summaries of user support requests.

Email Delivery: Integrates with the Resend API to ensure high deliverability, sending emails directly to your team's inbox.

Security: Promotes best practices by using environment variables for API keys.

Phase 2: Enhanced Functionality (Planned)
The next stage focuses on enhancing the core functionality by making the SDK more flexible and powerful for the user. This phase is about adding features that go beyond the basic support use case.

Custom Templates: Allow developers to use their own HTML templates for generated emails. This will be implemented by passing a template path or string to the sendEmail function.

Multi-language Support: Use OpenAI's language detection capabilities to automatically draft responses in the user's native language. This will be an optional parameter in the core function.

File Attachments: Enable the ability to attach log files or screenshots to the support email, making it a more comprehensive tool for technical support.

Phase 3: The Generic Engine (Future)
The long-term vision is to transform the SDK into a generic "prompt-to-channel" engine. This will abstract the communication channel, allowing the SDK to send AI-drafted content to various platforms, not just email.

Channel Abstraction: The core functions will be refactored to accept a channel parameter (e.g., 'email', 'slack', 'discord'). The SDK will then route the generated content to the appropriate service.

Custom Prompting: The prompt that guides the AI will be made configurable, allowing developers to easily create new use cases (e.g., generating marketing copy, creating social media posts).

Advanced AI Models: Add support for different OpenAI models (e.g., gpt-4-turbo) or even other AI services, giving the developer a choice based on their needs and budget.

This phased plan provides a clear vision for the project's evolution. Is there a specific functionality from the roadmap you'd like to dive into and start building?
